# Multi_camera synced Instructions

> The purpose of this document is to explain how to use multi-camera synced with OrbbecSDK_ROS2

## Setup instructions

* Please read the Multi-Camera Synchronization Setup Guide:[Multi-Camera Synchronization Setup](https://www.orbbec.com/docs/set-up-cameras-for-external-synchronization_v1-2/)
* Make sure the camera is correctly connected to the multi-camera synchronizer.

### Checking camera port with OrbbecSDK_ROS2

```bash
ros2 run orbbec_camera list_devices_node
```

### OrbbecSDK_ROS2 multi-camera synced configuration

Open multi_camera_synced.launch.py, and configure the camera settings as shown below:

![Depth Point Cloud Visualization](../image/multi_camera_synced/multi_camera_synced2.png)

1. `gemini_330_series.launch.py` is the launch file for starting the camera.

2. Set `camera_name` to `G330_0`. For example, the published color image topic will be `/G330_0/color/image_raw`.

3. Set `usb_port` to `2-2`, indicating that the camera device on port `2-2` is being used. This value can be found in the output of the `ros2 run orbbec_camera list_devices_node` command.

4. Set `device_num` to `2`, meaning two cameras will be used.

5. Set `sync_mode` to `primary` to indicate that the `2-7` camera device is in primary mode. The multi-camera sync mode options can be found in the figure below.

6. Parameters from the `config_file_path` can override the parameters set in `gemini_330_series.launch.py` (optional).

7. For slave cameras, set `trigger_out_enabled` to false.

* The master camera should be launched last.
* Ideally, there should be a 2-second delay between starting each camera.

### Run the following command to start the multi-camera synced

```bash
ros2 launch orbbec_camera multi_camera_synced.launch.py
```
